						<h3>The history of the creation of the Kazan Cathedral in St. Petersburg</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="info__text">
						<p>The construction of the cathedral began in the 19th century and lasted for 10 long years, from 1801 to 1811. Work was carried out on the site of the dilapidated Nativity of the Theotokos Church. The famous at that time A.N. Voronikhin was chosen as the architect. Only domestic materials were used for the works: limestone, granite, marble, Pudost stone. In 1811, the consecration of the temple finally took place. Six months later, the Kazan icon of the Mother of God, famous for the creation of miracles, was transferred to him for safekeeping.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="info__text">
						<p>During the years of Soviet power, which had a negative attitude to religion, many expensive things (silver, icons, interior items) were taken out of the church. In 1932, it was completely closed and did not hold services until the collapse of the USSR. In 2000, it was given the status of a cathedral, and 8 years later, a second rite of consecration took place.</p>

						<h3>Short description</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="info__text">
						<p>The temple was built in honor of the Kazan miraculous icon of the Mother of God, which is its most important shrine. The author of the project adhered to the "Empire" style of architecture, imitating the churches of the Roman Empire. It is not surprising that the entrance to the Kazan Cathedral is decorated with a beautiful colonnade designed in the form of a semicircle.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="info__img">
						<img src="img/kasan/Kolonny-sobora.jpg" alt="">
					</div>
					<div class="info__text">
						<p>The building stretched 72.5 m from West to East and 57 m from North to South. It is crowned with a dome located 71.6 m above the ground. This ensemble is complemented by numerous pilasters and sculptures. From the side of Nevsky Prospect you are greeted by sculptures of Alexander Nevsky, St. Vladimir, Andrew the First-Called and John the Baptist. Directly above their heads are bas-reliefs depicting scenes from the life of the Mother of God.</p>

					<div class="info__img">

					<div class="info__text">
						<p>On the facade of the temple there are six-column porticoes with the "All-Seeing Eye" bas-relief, which are decorated with triangular pediments. The entire upper part is decorated with a voluminous attic. The shape of the building itself mimics the shape of the Latin cross. Massive cornices complement the overall picture.</p>

					<div class="info__img">

					</div>
					<div class="info__text">
						<p>The main room of the cathedral is divided into three naves (corridors) - side and central. It resembles a Roman basilica in shape. Massive granite columns serve as partitions. The ceilings are over 10 m high and are decorated with rosettes. Alabaster was used to create credibility in the work. The floor is paved with gray-pink marble mosaic. The pulpit and altar in the Kazan Cathedral have areas with quartzite.</p>

					<div class="info__text">
						<p>The cathedral has become so popular that there is even a 25-ruble coin in circulation with its image. It was issued in 2011 by the Bank of Russia with a circulation of 1,500 pieces. Gold of the highest standard, 925, was used for its manufacture.</p>
						<p>Of greatest interest is the main shrine of the cathedral - the icon of the Mother of God. In 1579, a severe fire broke out in Kazan, but the fire did not touch the icon, and it remained intact under a pile of ash. Two weeks later, the Mother of God appeared to the girl Matrona Onuchina and told her to dig up her image. It is still unknown whether this is a copy or an original.</p>

					<div class="info__text">
						<p>Rumor has it that during the October Revolution, the Bolsheviks confiscated the original image of the Virgin from the Kazan Cathedral, and the list was written only in the 19th century. Despite this, miracles near the icon continue to happen from time to time.</p>
						<p>The Kazan Cathedral is a very valuable structure for St. Petersburg, which is almost impossible to find analogues. It is mandatory included in most excursion routes in St. Petersburg, which annually pass thousands of tourists from different parts of the world. It is an important site of the cultural, religious and architectural heritage of Russia.</p>
