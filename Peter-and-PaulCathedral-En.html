						<h1>Peter and Paul Cathedral</h1>
					</div>
					<div class="info__text">
						<p>Peter and Paul Cathedral (the official name of the Cathedral in the name of the supreme apostles Peter and Paul) is an Orthodox cathedral in St. Petersburg in the Peter and Paul Fortress, the tomb of Russian emperors, an architectural monument of the Peter and Paul Baroque. The sacraments of baptism and wedding were not performed here. Under the vaults of the cathedral, funerals were performed for members of the Russian ruling family and grand dukes close to the imperial house.</p>

						<h3>A bit of history</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="info__text">
						<p>The first church in the name of the apostles Peter and Paul on the territory of the fortress was founded in 1703, somewhat later than the date of the foundation of the fortification itself. The stone cathedral on this site began to be built in 1712. Its construction took more than a dozen years, it was completed by 1733, that is, the first Russian emperor did not live to see the completion of construction for several years. By the way, the wooden Peter and Paul Church was not destroyed, but dismantled and transported to Gorodovaya (Petrogradsky) Island. Today the site of the construction is the Matveevsky Garden.</p>

					<div class="info__text">
						<p>Let's return to the stone cathedral on the territory of the fortress. Its construction was supervised by one of the first architects who worked in St. Petersburg, the famous Domenico Trezzini, the author of the projects for the building of the Twelve Collegia and the Summer Palace of Peter.</p>
						<p>According to Peter's idea, the new building was supposed to surpass the Menshikov Tower and the Ivan the Great Bell Tower in Moscow in height. And so it happened: the cathedral is 32 meters higher than the latter. Today, the spire of the Peter and Paul Cathedral, thanks to restructuring, has increased by another 10.5 meters. By the way, the angel placed on his bell tower is considered the official historical symbol of St. Petersburg.

					<div class="info__text">
						<p>Since its construction, the Peter and Paul Cathedral served as a burial vault for the Romanov dynasty. During the reign of Peter, burials of his two sons and four daughters appeared here. Peter himself and all the following emperors (with the exception of Peter II and John VI) are also buried on the territory of the cathedral. In 1896-1908, the Grand Ducal tomb was added to the building.</p>
						<p>After the coming of Soviet power, the building of the Peter and Paul Cathedral was transferred to the Museum of the Revolution; later, its premises were occupied by the warehouse of the Central Book Chamber. And in 1954, the complex was transferred to the State Museum of the History of Leningrad (now St. Petersburg), whose branches today are not only the Peter and Paul Fortress, but also, for example, the Oreshek Fortress and Rumyantsev's mansion at 44 Angliyskaya Embankment.

						<h3>Cathedral architecture</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="info__text">
						<p>The Peter and Paul Cathedral was built in the traditions of European architecture - in the form of an elongated rectangle 30 by 60 meters. The building of the "hall" type looks simple and modest. The walls are decorated with flat columns - pilasters - with the heads of cherubs on the window frames. On the eastern façade there is a fresco by artist P. Titov "The appearance of the apostles Peter and Paul before Christ". The western facade, which serves as the base of the bell tower, is decorated with six pilasters on both sides of the main entrance.</p>

					<div class="info__text">
						<p>At the request of the tsar, a bell tower with a spire was first erected: Peter I needed an observation deck to observe the approaching Swedes. The bell tower symbolized the return of the Neva lands to Russia. Peter was proud of the city under construction and personally went up with foreign guests to the bell tower standing in the forests to admire the panorama of the capital.
</p>
						<p>A multi-tiered 100-meter bell tower decorated with pilasters is the main part of the cathedral. The two lower tiers, spreading out in breadth, form a transition to the high tower. The third tier directed upwards is crowned with a gilded eight-pitched roof, which is decorated with 4 round windows in massive white stone frames.</p>

					<div class="info__img">
						<img src="img/peter/peter-and-paul-cathedral-in-st-petersburg-4.jpg" alt="">
					</div>
					<div class="info__text">
						<p>Above the roof is a graceful octagonal drum with narrow vertical openings. Above it there is a high golden crown with a thin golden turret on which a 40-meter spire is installed. There are 103 bells on the bell tower of the Peter and Paul Cathedral, 31 of the original ones.</p>
						<p>The spire is crowned with the figure of an angel with a 6.5-meter cross in his hands. The wingspan is 3.8 meters. The height of the figure is 3.3 meters, the weight of the structure is 250 kg. The angel over the city, giving lightness and aspiration to the building upward, is the guardian of the new Russian capital from the vicissitudes of fate.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="info__text">
						<p>Peter did not see the flying angel, he died in January 1725, when the bell tower was unfinished. On June 29, 1833, the new Empress Anna Ioannovna received congratulations at the consecration of the cathedral.
</p>
						<p>A chime clock, a miracle of the new city of St. Petersburg, was installed on the bell tower. The clock sang the church and monarchical hymn and stopped from the 18th century to the present day 2 times - during the years of the revolution and during the Great Patriotic War.</p>

					<div class="info__text">
						<p>In revolutionary times, the Bolsheviks shot the watch for the hated anthem: bullet marks remained. On June 25, 1926, the chimes of the Peter and Paul Cathedral in Leningrad played the Internationale for the first time.</p>
						<p>In Soviet times, a converted clock mechanism sang the anthem of the Soviet Union. Now the chimes are again playing the national anthem of the Russian Empire. The anthem "God Save the Tsar ..." is performed at 12:00 and 18:00, and every 15 minutes - a chime of 4 musical phrases.
</p>
						<p>There was also a corillon in the bell tower - a musical instrument with keys and 51 bells, brought by the tsar from Amsterdam and bought for huge money. The corillon was removed from the bell tower in the 19th century, and in 2001 a new one was installed, made for the Peter and Paul Cathedral in Holland. 51 carillon bells were cast with sponsors' funds. On one of them the inscription: "May this bell ring for the glory of Russia!"

						<h3>Interior decoration</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="info__text">
						<p>The internal space, divided into 3 parts by powerful columns, resembles a grand hall, magnificent and solemn, and not a temple for worshipers. The columns are decorated with marble, jasper, rhodonite. The floor is paved with limestone slabs.</p>
						<p>Under the vaults - 18 paintings on the Gospel subjects, an innovation introduced by Peter, before the walls of the temples were decorated with frescoes. The paintings were entrusted to write to a Dutch foreigner Georg Gsell, whom Peter met in Amsterdam, and to two Russian "painting masters" - Vasily Ignatiev and Andrey Matveev. The stucco decoration was done by Ignazio Rossi and Antonio Quadri.</p>

					<div class="info__img">
						<img src="img/peter/peter-and-paul-cathedral-in-st-petersburg-6.jpg" alt="">
					</div>
					<div class="info__text">
						<p>The festive atmosphere of the temple is supported by an abundance of light pouring from large windows and five chandeliers of gilded bronze, colored Venetian glass and rock crystal. Elegant decor and trophy banners emphasize the solemnity of the high-rise 122-meter cathedral.</p>
						<p>Opposite the altar, at the left column, there is a gilded pulpit for delivering sermons, to which a spiral wooden staircase leads, decorated with paintings on the theme of the biblical saying: "In the beginning was the word."</p>
						<p>In Orthodox churches, sermons were not read before - it was introduced by Peter I. The canopy above the pulpit is decorated with sculptural images of the apostles Peter and Paul and four evangelists. The composition is crowned with a dove spreading its wings - the Holy Spirit. From the word to the Spirit - this is the idea of decorating the pulpit.</p>
						<p>On the opposite side of the pulpit there is a royal place, a low platform upholstered in velvet with gold embroidery and topped with a gilded carved crown. Nearby are the attributes of power: a scepter and a sword. The emperor stood there during the divine services: there is no chair here, the tsar did not sit in the cathedral.

					<div class="info__text">
						<p>Trophy banners, keys to fortresses and cities captured by Russian soldiers were kept in the temple for 200 years. There are two thrones in the church: the main one in the name of the holy apostles Peter and Paul, the second in honor of the Great Martyr Catherine.</p>
