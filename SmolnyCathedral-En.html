						<h1>Smolny Cathedral</h1>
					</div>
					<div class="info__text">
						<p>Smolny Cathedral was built as the central building of the Smolny Monastery. The name "Smolny" is due to the fact that at the beginning of the 18th century. at this place was the Smolyanoy Dvor, where resin was cooked for the needs of the Admiralty shipyard. By order of Elizabeth Petrovna, in 1748 the architect Rastrelli began to build a monastery there, which was named Resurrection Novodevichy Smolny by the historical name of the area. Legend has it that Empress Elizabeth wanted to retire to this monastery in her old age. The first nuns were transferred here from the Novodevichy monasteries in Moscow and Smolensk.</p>

						<h3>General information</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="info__text">
						<p>The building of Smolny Cathedral is located in the center of the monastery courtyard, surrounded by two-storey residential buildings along the perimeter with light turrets of house churches in the corners. The Smolny Monastery complex is a true masterpiece of Russian Baroque. It was said that the famous architect Quarenghi, passing by him, took off his hat every time as a sign of respect to the genius of Rastrelli.</p>
						<p>However, after the death of the royal customer, the construction came to a standstill, not being completed. The monastery complex was given by the new Empress Catherine II under the Institute for Noble Maidens, a privileged closed educational institution, where girls from 6-18 years old from noble families were brought up. The best of the pupils at the end of their studies were determined for the court service.</p>
						<p>As for the Smolny Cathedral, Rastrelli only managed to bring it under the roof. For a long time it stood unfinished, it was completed only in the 1830s. another architect is Vasily Stasov. After the revolution, the cathedral was closed. Now the restored building is used as a concert and exhibition hall.</p>
						<p>The square in front of the cathedral became known as Rastrelli square in Soviet times.</p>
						<p>A legitimate question arises: what happened to the convent? With the death of the last nuns, monastic life within the walls of the Smolny Convent died out. The resurrection of the Novodevichy Convent of the Resurrection took place only during the reign of Nicholas I and already in a new place - on the present Moskovsky Avenue.
</p>
						<p>Those who entered St. Petersburg through the Moscow Outpost already from afar saw a high four-tier bell tower with a gilded dome, reminiscent of the Ivan the Great bell tower in the Moscow Kremlin. Behind a stone fence, separated from the road by green trees, were the two-storey buildings of the new monastery complex. In the center stood the new Resurrection Cathedral with a massive onion dome and four small domes. Alexander Blok wrote about this monastery in the poem "Retribution":</p>
						<ul>
							<li class="info__contentItem">Beyond the city limits,</li>
							<li class="info__contentItem">Where the golden-headed one shines</li>
							<li class="info__contentItem">Novodevichy Convent,</li>
							<li class="info__contentItem">Fences, slaughterhouses and wasteland</li>
							<li class="info__contentItem">Before the Moscow outpost ...</li>
						</ul>
						<p>In Soviet times, the monastery was closed, the cathedral was plundered, the bell tower was blown up. The monastery cemetery was badly damaged, where many famous statesmen and public figures, poets, composers, writers (Tyutchev, Vrubel, Napravnik, Nekrasov, Maikov, Botkin and others) are buried. In this cemetery there is a famous tombstone with the figure of Christ, where Leningraders came to pray during the terrible time of siege.</p>
						<p>After the war, the surviving buildings without domes and tents housed the Research Institute of Electrical Engineering. Now the monastery is being restored, and its buildings are being restored. On the main building, domes were installed on the roof of the temple, and recently they already shine with a new gilding. If you want to see it, you need to take the metro to the Moskovskie Vorota station and walk a little along the opposite side of Moskovsky Prospekt in the direction of decreasing numbering of houses.</p>
