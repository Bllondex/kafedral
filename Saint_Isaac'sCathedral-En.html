						<h1>Saint Isaac's Cathedral
</h1>
					</div>
					<div class="info__text">
						<p>Isaac's Cathedral is the most famous and largest church in St. Petersburg, an outstanding example of Russian religious architecture. It is one of the most significant and beautiful domed buildings in the entire world. The scale of the building is impressive: it is the fourth largest Christian shrine after the Roman Cathedral of St. Peter, London's Church of St. Paul and the Florentine Church of St. Mary.</p>
						<p>The height of the building is 101.5 m, and its capacity is about 12 thousand people. Today, St. Isaac's Cathedral has been given the status of a memorial museum, but four times a year, on the most significant holidays, religious services are held here. The official name is the temple of St. Isaac of Dalmatia, in whose honor the church was built.</p>

						<h3>Construction history</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="info__text">
						<p>Emperor Peter I was born on May 30 according to the Julian calendar, on the day of remembrance of the canonized Byzantine monk Isaac of Dalmatia, therefore the monarch always treated the figure of this saint with special respect. In 1710, the emperor issued a decree on the construction of a temple in honor of Isaac near the Admiralty building. A wooden church was erected at this place, or rather, a drawing room at the naval department was reequipped for it with small additions. Already in 1712, the sovereign married here with his wife Ekaterina Alekseevna.
</p>

					</div>
					<div class="info__text">
						<p>In 1717 it was decided to start equipping the city with stone temples, and according to the plan, St. Isaac's Church was to be the first to undergo modernization. In the same year, Peter I personally laid the first stone of the new cathedral. If the first building was notable for its simplicity, like most buildings at the beginning of the reign of the emperor, then the second was already conceived in the style of Peter's Baroque. The construction of the shrine was completed 10 years later, and during all this time the work was supervised by three different architects.</p>
						<p>Then the temple was in the place where the famous "Bronze Horseman" is erected today. It was an unfortunate place, since the foundation of the structure was constantly eroded by the Neva. Constant costly renovations forced the city senate to look for a new site for the cathedral. Already in 1761, a corresponding decree was adopted.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="info__img">

					</div>
					<div class="info__text">
						<p>But the laying of the third St. Isaac's Church took place only in 1768, after the approval of the decree of Catherine II, who ascended the throne. It was supposed to be a large cathedral with five complex domes and a high bell tower. However, due to the death of the Empress and the change of the architect, the unfinished part was completed in a hurry, according to a greatly simplified project. The result was a luxurious base up to the cornice, trimmed with marble, on top of which a simple brick superstructure towered. It had only one dome and a much lower bell tower than planned.
</p>
						<p>The temple was consecrated only in 1802. Since the church was built according to the decrees of three different autocrats, it was strongly discordant with the general appearance of the center of St. Petersburg. That is why, already in 1809, a project was announced to create a new</p>
						<p>The improved project of St. Isaac's Cathedral was approved only by 1818, its author was the Frenchman Auguste Montferrand. The main condition of the new emperor was the preservation of the luxurious altar part, as well as the pylons under the dome. The cathedral grew significantly in size, acquiring completely new outlines: a large central dome with four smaller ones, a high colonnade. Over time, the project has undergone some changes, but its main part has remained the same. The completed temple was consecrated in 1858.

						<h3>Rich decoration of facades</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="info__text">
						<p>Outside, the building is decorated with gray marble columns, and each of the four facades is decorated with unique sculptural subjects. The general style refers to the classicism of the late period with elements of neo-Renaissance, eclecticism, and Byzantine trends.</p>
						<p>The north facade shows the scene of the resurrection of Christ, the corners of the pediments are decorated with statues of the apostles John, Peter and Paul. Doors and niches are made with the participation of relief images of saints, as well as scenes from the Bible.
</p>
						<p>The western one contains a bas-relief scene of the meeting between Emperor Theodosius and Isaac of Dalmatia, which symbolizes the unity of heavenly and worldly power. Also on this side of the temple there are bas-relief images of the miracles of Christ, sculptures of the apostles Thomas, Mark, Bartholomew.
</p>

					</div>
					<div class="info__text">
						<p>On the southern facade of St. Isaac's Cathedral there is a relief, the plot for which was the biblical scene of the adoration of the Magi. Niches and doors are decorated with famous scenes from the New Testament, pediments are crowned with sculptures of the apostles Matthew, Andrew, Philip.
</p>
						<p>The eastern one, facing Nevsky Prospekt, is decorated with a bas-relief depicting Emperor Valens and Isaac of Dalmatia. The saint blocks the way of the Byzantine sovereign, prophesying his imminent death. For this, Isaac is tied in chains and sent to prison. Also on the pediments are sculptures of the apostles Luke, James and Simon.</p>

						<h3>Cathedral interiors</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="info__text">
						<p>The luxurious interior of the temple and its scale amaze the imagination. There are three altars at once. The main one is dedicated to Isaac of Dalmatia, the right one - to Alexander Nevsky, the left one - to Martyr Catherine. The interior surfaces are finished with valuable types of stone: malachite, marble, lapis lazuli, siltstone, shungite and so on. Some scenes are made using gilded bronze, glass and stone mosaics.
</p>
						<p>Many famous Russian artists of the 19th century worked on the paintings here: K. Bryullov, F. Riess, F. Bruni, I. Burukhin and others. Among the sculptors worked P. Claude, I. Vitali, N. Pimenov. In the window of the main altar there is such an element, unusual for an Orthodox church, as a stained glass window. It depicts the scene of the resurrection of the Savior. The sketches and direct embodiment of such a large glass picture (over 28 square meters) are the work of German masters.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="info__text">
						<p>In general, more than 150 masterpieces from masters of Russian painting are located inside the temple. The painting of St. Isaac's Cathedral was not without difficulties: the classical frescoes were recognized as a method unsuitable due to the climatic features of the area. The artists decided to paint the interior with oil paints, but this idea was not the most successful either: the soil did not dry well, lagged behind the base. Because of this, artists sometimes had to rewrite entire paintings.</p>
						<p>Only in 1855 a composition suitable for painting was invented. In addition, the walls began to be decorated with mosaics, which were much easier to implement in the local climatic conditions. These typesetting panels were highly appreciated at the World's Fair in London, held in 1862. The spectacular combination of gilding, colored glass and stone creates a sublime atmosphere within the temple.</p>

						<h3>Interesting Facts</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="info__text">
						<p>During the Revolution of 1917 and the establishment of Soviet power, the decoration and ornaments of the cathedral suffered quite a lot, silver and gold utensils were removed from there, all available gold parts were removed. The church itself became the premises for an anti-religious museum.</p>
						<p>In air raids on the city during World War II, German pilots never aimed directly at the cathedral. Its facades were damaged only by shrapnel and exploding shells.</p>
						<p>The architect Montferrand built St. Isaac's Cathedral for 40 years, in connection with this rumors were born that the master should have died after the completion of the work. In reality, the author and project manager really lived only a month after the church was consecrated.</p>
