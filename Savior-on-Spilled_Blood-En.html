						<h1>Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood</h1>
					</div>
					<div class="info__text">
						<p>Savior on Spilled Blood in St. Petersburg is one of the most beautiful and magnificent cathedrals not only in the city on the Neva, but throughout Russia. It is both an Orthodox church and a memorial monument reminding one of the tragic pages in the history of our country. Located in the historical center of the Northern capital, on the embankment of the Griboyedov Canal, which in the past was called Catherine's, the Savior on Spilled Blood impresses with its monumentality and grandeur.

					<div class="info__text">
						<p>Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ on Blood - this is the full name of this temple - in its execution a little resembles St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow. In addition, the Moscow Trinity churches in Ostankino and Nikitki, as well as Yaroslavl ones: John the Baptist in Tolchkov and John Chrysostom in Korovniki, became prototypes for him. However, the differences between it and the named religious buildings are obvious. The Savior on the Spilled Blood is completely unique and distinctive not only in terms of architectural but also artistic characteristics.</p>
						<p>A quadrangular building crowned with five large and four smaller chapters, three rounded apses with golden chapters on the east side and kokoshnik pediments adorning the northern and southern facades make this monumental Orthodox shrine recognizable throughout the world. No less impressive is the height of the Savior on Spilled Blood, which is 81 meters, and its capacity - up to 1600 people can simultaneously be inside.</p>

						<p>Some tourists, especially those who come to St. Petersburg and Russia for the first time, do not even realize that the Cathedral of the Savior on Spilled Blood was erected over the place where real blood was really shed more than 135 years ago. The terrible event that happened then predetermined the appearance here of a memorial single-altar church, which became a symbol of the repentance of the entire people for the act committed by a handful of adventurers. The mere fact that funds for the construction were collected throughout Russia speaks for itself.</p>
						<p>The Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ on Blood is a striking monument of Russian architecture, in which the best traditions of the Russian architectural style are embodied. Currently, it is a museum, acquaintance with which is invariably included in the excursion programs in the Northern capital.</p>

						<h3>Construction background</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="info__text">
						<p>The second half of the 19th century was very difficult for Russia. On the one hand, the state was weakened by participation in the Crimean War and the difficult situation in the economy, on the other hand, large-scale transformations took place, at the origins of which was Emperor Alexander II. This is, first of all, about the abolition of serfdom in 1861, which became a powerful impetus for the further development of the country. Having freed 23 million peasants from landlord slavery, he received the noble nickname "Tsar-Liberator" among the people and went down in history.</p>
						<p>At the same time, the reforms carried out by the sovereign - zemstvo, judicial, military, education and a number of others -, although they brought generally positive changes, but there were mistakes in their implementation, which provoked the strengthening of the revolutionary movement. Part of the population was dissatisfied with the innovations, and the radicals took advantage of this, who entered the struggle against the autocracy - they considered it the main evil. At the end of the 70s, the Narodnaya Volya organization emerged, which used terror in its methods of struggle. They set out to kill the tsar and a number of representatives of the country's top leadership, believing that their removal would set in motion the masses who would overthrow the autocracy, and the huge empire would become a republic.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="info__img">
						<img src="img/Spas/4_Imperator-Aleksandr-II.jpg" alt="">
					</div>
					<div class="info__text">
						<p>Having proclaimed such intentions, they immediately proceeded to implement their plans, having delivered a death sentence to Alexander II and began a real hunt for the autocrat. Several attempts were organized on him, which followed one after another. The terrorist attacks were not crowned with success, but many innocent people died during their commission. In response, the authorities were forced to intensify repressions against the "Narodnaya Volya" and even make some concessions. However, this seems to only provoke the regicides. And on March 1, 1881, they staged another attempt on the king's life, which was the last.</p>
						<p>A brutal terrorist attack was carefully prepared, and therefore achieved its goal this time. This happened at the moment when the emperor, returning from the military parade in the Mikhailovsky Manege, was driving along the embankment of the Catherine Canal in his carriage: the revolutionary N. Rusakov threw a bomb at her. Several people from the retinue were seriously injured, including fatal ones, but the king survived and refused to immediately leave the place of the attempt. One of the accompanying bodyguards, with the help of the crowd, twisted the intruder, another ran up to report that the villain had already been caught. "Thank God, I survived, but here ..." - said the emperor, pointing to the wounded moaning on the pavement. At that moment, a second bomb was thrown at his feet, thrown by another terrorist who was waiting in the wings - I. Grinevitsky ...</p>
						<p>When the powder smoke cleared, the people, struck with horror, saw a bloody body spread on the ground. "Hurry ... in the palace ... to die there," whispered the wounded Grand Duke Mikhail Nikolaevich, who was bending over him. These were his last words, and at 16:35, already in the Winter Palace, the emperor died. The son of the late Alexander III decided to perpetuate the memory of his father with a temple at the site of his villainous murder. The construction, which lasted for almost 25 years, was carried out according to the project of the architect Parland and the abbot of the Trinity-Sergius Hermitage, Archimandrite Ignatius.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="info__img">
						<img src="img/Spas/6_Aleksandr-II-na-smertnom-odre.jpg" alt="">
					</div>
					<div class="info__text">
						<p>The perfect regicide shook the whole country. The expectations of Narodnaya Volya that the people would then come out to overthrow the autocracy were not justified. People, on the contrary, strove to get to the scene of the terrorist attack in order to pray for the soul of the emperor and those who died from among those accompanying him. The believers were especially indignant when they saw in the tragic death of the emperor an echo of the evangelical events. Then, in biblical times, Jesus Christ died on the cross, having atoned for the sins of all mankind, and Tsar Alexander Nikolaevich, like him, was killed for the sins of the Russian people, so it is not surprising that the idea of ​​perpetuating the memory of the martyr was born by itself.</p>
						<p>This desire has embraced all segments of the population, including the poorest. And now, several years later, at the place where the emperor was mortally wounded, his son and successor Alexander III ordered to build a temple-monument, a temple-repentance. Its construction, which lasted 24 years, continued the long tradition of erecting religious buildings to commemorate important historical events or in memory of the victims. By issuing a corresponding decree, the emperor supported the decision of the St. Petersburg City Duma. True, the deputies suggested building a chapel on the site of the tsar's wound. The emperor, on the other hand, considered that a real temple should stand on this place.</p>
						<p>However, the construction of a full-fledged religious building was not easy and not quick, and I did not want to waste time. At the place of the emperor's death, it was decided to first install a wooden hipped-roof chapel, which was built by the architect L.N. Benois at the expense of the merchant I.F. On April 17, 1881, Alexander II, if he were alive, would have turned 63 years old, and his birthday was chosen as the date of the consecration of this chapel.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="info__text">
						<p>The requiem for the repose of the soul of Tsar Alexander Nikolaevich was performed here every day. Part of the pavement and a small section of the embankment fence, on which there were traces of the emperor's blood - all this was very clearly visible through the glass doors of the chapel. Two years later, it was moved to Konyushennaya Square and subsequently dismantled, and in its place the construction of the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood began.</p>

						<h3>How the Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ on Blood was built</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="info__text">
						<p>The start of work was preceded by two competitions for the best project at once. The first 26 of them were ready on December 31, 1881. Many architects of that time, such as I. Bogomolov, A. L. Gun, I. S. Kitner, already mentioned L. N. Benois, and a number of others, presented their vision of the future temple-monument. A special commission selected 8 projects that it considered the most successful, while recognizing the best work by AI Tomishko, executed in the Russian-Byzantine style and named "Father of the Fatherland".</p>
						<p>The winning projects, of course, were demonstrated to the current sovereign, but he did not like any of them. Alexander III wanted to see in the future church features of truly Russian architecture inherent in churches of the 17th century, especially in Yaroslavl. And the actual place where the king was mortally wounded had to be formalized as a separate chapel.</p>
						<p>The second competition, the results of which were announced on April 28, 1882, also did not reveal the final winner. It has already presented 31 projects, their authors were many famous architects - for example, R. P. Kuzmin, N. V. Sultanov, R. A. Gedike, A. I. Rezanov, A. L. Ober, A. N Benoit and others. Alexander III was forced to reject them too, since no work corresponded to his vision of the future cathedral.</p>
						<p>And now, after some time, finally, a project appeared, which, although not completely, still satisfied the discerning tastes of the sovereign. Its developers were the architect Alfred Parland and the rector of the Trinity-Sergius Hermitage, Archimandrite Ignatius (Malyshev). The Emperor imposed his highest resolution on him on July 29, 1883 and ordered the authors to finalize their research, and on May 1, 1887 it was finally approved.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="info__img">

					</div>
					<div class="info__text">
						<p>The first stone in the foundation of the temple, however, was laid back in October 1883. A special commission was formed to build the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood, headed by Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich, the youngest son of the deceased king. The commission included architects R.B Bernhard, D.I. Grimm, A.I. Zhiber, R.A.Gedike, who made adjustments to the project in the course of work. I.V.Shtorm played a significant role in improving the cathedral: thanks to his suggestions, the overall composition of the temple only won.</p>
						<p>If it were not for the mosaic work, which did not progress as fast as we would like, then the consecration of the Savior on the Blood could have happened ten years earlier. And now this long-awaited and blessed day has come: on August 6 (19), 1907, on the day of the Orthodox holiday of the Transfiguration of the Lord, the consecration ceremony was performed by Metropolitan Anthony (Vadkovsky). It was furnished very solemnly, with the participation of Emperor Nicholas II and members of his family. Less than a year later, in April 1908, the same Metropolitan Anthony consecrated the Iberian chapel-sacristy, which stood next to the Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ on Blood. The sacristy was a repository of icons that were ever offered in memory of the tragic death of Alexander II.
</p>
						<p>The Savior on Spilled Blood was built using the latest technologies for those years, so it can rightfully be called one of the most modern buildings of the early 20th century. Moreover, it was even fully electrified, which even many important government institutions could not dream of. 1689 lamps illuminated the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood from the inside, which at that time was simply unthinkable! As for the cost of the entire construction, it is estimated at a rather impressive amount - 4.6 million rubles. The Cathedral in memory of the slain Tsar-Liberator was the second religious building of St. Petersburg after St. Isaac's Cathedral, which, being under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, was entirely supported by the state.</p>

						<h3>Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood in Soviet times and today
</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="info__text">
						<p>The Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ on Blood differed from other churches in that it was not planned for mass visits. Parishioners could enter it only with passes. Some of the services held there were dedicated to the memory of Alexander II, who died at the hands of terrorists. In September 1907, Professor P.I. Leporsky was appointed rector of the cathedral.
</p>
						<p>After the October Revolution of 1917, the Bolshevik government ceased to allocate funds for the maintenance of the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood. As a result, the abbot had no choice but to appeal to the Petrograd people with a request for support of the cathedral in these difficult times and, if possible, financially, contributing to its maintenance the amounts he could afford.
</p>
						<p>At the end of 1919, the city authorities decided to organize a parish at the Church of the Resurrection of Christ on Blood. Pyotr Leporsky actively objected to this, rightly noting that he was never a parish. But the Petrosovet did not give up on its own, and already on January 11, 1920, the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood was transferred to the so-called "twenty", that is, the newly formed parish. In 1922-1923 the cathedral was run by the Petrograd autocephaly under the leadership of Nikolai (Yaroshevich), Bishop of Peterhof.</p>
						<p>After the Deputy of the Patriarchal Locum Tenens, Metropolitan Sergei (Stragorodsky) issued a "declaration" proclaiming unconditional loyalty to the communist regime, the Savior on Spilled Blood became the center of the opposition movement in the Russian Orthodox Church known as Josephlyism. His followers did not support the line of cooperation with the Bolsheviks. And for the latter, the case did not become: on October 30, 1930, according to the decree of the Presidium of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, the temple was closed.</p>

					<div class="info__text">
						<p>A year later, the commission of the Leningrad Regional Council on Cults made a justification that it was advisable to dismantle the Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ on Blood, only the implementation of this task was decided to be postponed indefinitely. In 1938, the authorities again returned to the question of the need to demolish the temple, and they had already decided it positively, but then the Great Patriotic War began, which distracted the city authorities to solve more important tasks. So, during the blockade, the building of the cathedral was used as a morgue for those who died from hunger, cold and wounds of Leningraders. After 1945, the scenery for the performances was kept in the former church, which by that time was rented by the Maly Theater.</p>

					<div class="info__text">
						<p>In the late 60s, the Savior on Spilled Blood was taken under state protection. In July 1970, it was decided to organize a branch of the St. Isaac's Cathedral museum, which became a salvation for this monumental structure from the final oblivion: after all, it was in disrepair and needed urgent restoration. In the early 80s, work started, the first stage of which was completed only in 1997. Then the memorial museum-monument "Savior on Spilled Blood" opened its doors to visitors, it happened exactly 90 years after its consecration.</p>
						<p>On May 23, 2004, Metropolitan of St. Petersburg and Ladoga Vladimir (Kotlyarov) served a solemn liturgy at the Savior on Spilled Blood - the first after a long break that stretched for more than seven decades. Ten years later, the parish of the Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ on Blood received official registration.</p>

						<h3>The architectural features of the temple</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="info__text">
						<p>Despite the fact that the Savior on Spilled Blood was built as a memorial temple in honor of the murdered emperor, its appearance is rather festive and bright. The temple is decorated with numerous figured platbands, kokoshniks, tiles, multi-colored tiles. At the heart of the cult building is a compact quadruple topped with five chapters covered with four-color jewelry enamel. All in all, there are nine of them in the temple, as mentioned above, and it is they who create that unique asymmetry that makes the Cathedral of the Savior on Spilled Blood one of the most recognizable on the banks of the Neva and in Russia.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="info__img">
						<img src="img/Spas/15_Kupola-khrama-Spasa_na_Krovi.jpg" alt="">
					</div>
					<div class="info__text">
						<p>The role of the central chapter is assigned to an 81-meter tent, at the base of which, on the wall, there are 8 oblong windows. Their platbands are made in the form of kokoshniks. The tent, which is narrowed at the top, is crowned by a lantern with a bulbous head with a cross. It is covered with white, green and yellow enamel in the form of stripes, which, as it were, wrap around it. Another element that makes the building recognizable is the domed bell tower in the southwestern part. It bears a certain resemblance to the Ivan the Great Bell Tower in the Moscow Kremlin.</p>
						<p>It is difficult to name materials that would not be used in the decoration of the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood: this is ordinary brick, granite, marble, and enamel, not to mention copper with gilding and mosaics. The walls, towers and domes are covered with magnificent patterns. Against the background of decorative red brick, white arches, arcades and the aforementioned kokoshnik pediments look amazingly harmonious. The mosaic plays a special role inside the temple, covering an area of ​​7065 sq. meters, and this exposition is one of the largest on the entire continent. It is not surprising that the Savior on Spilled Blood is called the "museum of mosaics". All this splendor was created in the studio of V.A.Frolov on the basis of sketches by a large number of artists - Vasnetsov, Koshelev, Parland, Nesterov and others. Mosaic panels depicting gospel subjects almost completely cover the walls, pylons, and ceilings. This is a stunning sight that will impress anyone, so we recommend that you go inside.</p>
						<p>The floor, laid out with colorful ornaments from marble slabs, surprisingly harmonizes with the mosaic decoration of the temple. The carved iconostasis is also made of Italian marble. In general, more than 20 types of various minerals were used in the design of the building (different types of marble, Ural and Altai jasper, porphyry, orlets, etc.).</p>
						<p>The main place in the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood is a fragment of the Catherine Canal, which includes a cobblestone pavement, sidewalk slabs and a part of a lattice - it is highlighted by a hipped canopy of jasper carved by domestic stone cutters. This fragment has remained intact since those tragic and memorable times, when it was here that Emperor Alexander II was mortally wounded. At this place, the "Crucifixion with the Persons" was installed, made of marble and granite. There are always red carnations. On the sides of this unique cross are icons depicting saints.
</p>
					</div>
					<div class="info__img">

					</div>
					<div class="info__text">
						<p>The external appearance of the temple and its interior decoration, if speaking as a whole, are thought out and executed in such a way as to emphasize even in the smallest detail its monumentality, subordination to one main task - perpetuating the repentance and memory of the Russian people about the innocently murdered Tsar-liberator.</p>
						<p>Thus, above the semicircular window of one of the bell towers of the Savior on Spilled Blood, there is a mosaic icon depicting the emperor's heavenly patron Saint Alexander Nevsky. In kokoshniks, we see images of the heavenly patrons of other members of the imperial family. In the niches of the false arcade (they are located in the lower part of the walls of the facade), two dozen boards are installed, on which the main transformations associated with the reign of the deceased are carved. Moreover, the boards are not wooden, but made of red granite.</p>
						<p>People came and are coming to the fragment of the embankment, where terrorists mortally wounded the emperor. Here they offer prayers for the repose of his soul. Memorial services near this tragic place are still being held.
